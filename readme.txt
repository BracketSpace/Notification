= HOW DOES IT WORK =

The Notification plugin is built with three main components:

* Trigger - a WordPress action, ie. User registration or Post publication
* Carrier - the thing which is being sent, ie. Email or Push
* Merge Tag - dynamic content, ie. {user_email} or {post_permalink}

You can use them in any combination, adding as many Notifications as you want. They can be sent to multiple Recipients with the content you write.

The process is simple:

* You select the Trigger
* Compose your message with Merge Tags
* Set Recipients
* Save the Notification

From now on the Notification is working. Test it out and add more!

= PERFECT FOR DEVELOPERS =

The Notification plugin is easy to set in the WordPress Admin, but it's even easier to extend with some sweet API.

You can create your own Triggers with any WordPress action. If you do in your code `do_action( 'my_plugin_doing_awesome_thing' )` you can create a Trigger out of it.

This allows you to use the Notification plugin as a notification system in your own plugin or theme. How? Well, because of two things:

* You can easily load it by copying the plugin files and including `load.php` file. A function known from Advanced Custom Fields plugin.
* You can white label the plugin with just one function which is shipped in the plugin's core. For free.

How easy extending the Notification plugin is? Let's see:

* Adding another Merge Tag to existing trigger - 1 line of code
* Creating custom Trigger - one intuitive class definition and registration with a single function call
* Defining Global Merge Tag - 1 line of code
* Creating new Extension - we have a [Boilerplate](https://github.com/BracketSpace/Notification-Extension-Boilerplate/) ready for you to start hacking

[See the developer documentation](https://docs.bracketspace.com/docs-category/developer/) if you don't believe us.

= DEFAULT NOTIFICATIONS =

* Email
* Webhook

= DEFAULT RECIPIENTS =

The plugin comes with few registered by default recipient types:

* Email address or Merge Tag – free type email address or a Merge Tag
* Administrator – takes an email from General Settings page
* User – takes an email from WordPress user profile
* Role – notify all Users having selected role at once

= DEFAULT TRIGGERS =

These are already defined in plugin’s core and are ready to use. You can enable or disable them on the Settings page.

== Installation ==

= Requirements =

This plugin require at least PHP 5.6.

= Plugin install =

Download and install this plugin from Plugins -> Add New admin screen.

= Distributing in a plugin or theme =

Notification can be loaded also as a part of any plugin or theme. To do it just include plugins's `load.php` file. It will figure out if it's loaded from theme or from plugin.

[See the detailed guide](https://docs.bracketspace.com/docs/including-notification-in-the-plugin-or-theme/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is this plugin different from Better Notifications for WordPress (BNFW)? =

The Notification plugin works very similar to BNFW but it has better codebase and interface. You can read the full comparison in the [Notification vs Better Notifications for WordPress](https://bracketspace.com/notification-vs-better-notifications-for-wordpress/) article.

= Why I'm not receiving any emails? =

Is your WordPress sending any emails at all? The best way to test it is to try to reset your password. If you don't get any email than there's something wrong with your server configuration. You could use any SMTP plugin to fix that.

You can also try to activate the debug log in plugin settings to see if the email is triggered.

= Is this plugin for regular users? =

Ofcourse it is! We are trying to make both parties happy - the Users and Developers. Users got their intuitive and beautiful panel in WordPress Admin and Developers got an awesome API by which they can extend the Notification plugin.

So it doesn't matter if you don't have any coding skills, they are not required to setup the notifications with this plugin.

= How to register my own triggers? =

With `register_trigger()` function. [See the detailed guide](https://docs.bracketspace.com/docs/registering-custom-triggers/)

= How to include a custom field in the notification? =

You can [write a merge tag](https://docs.bracketspace.com/docs/adding-merge-tags-to-existing-triggers/) by yourself or go with a no-brainer [Custom Fields extension](https://bracketspace.com/downloads/notification-custom-fields/).

= How to target only specific post / category / user etc? =

You can control when exactly the notification is sending with the [Conditionals extension](https://bracketspace.com/downloads/notification-conditionals/).

= Can I bundle the plugin with my plugin or theme? =

Yes, you can. [See the detailed guide](https://docs.bracketspace.com/docs/including-notification-in-the-plugin-or-theme/)

= Is this plugin capable of sending high volume emails? =

The plugin is capable and it can send milions of emails, but probably your server is not. To send thousands of emails at once we'd suggest using [SendGrid](https://bracketspace.com/downloads/notification-sendgrid/) or [Mailgun](https://bracketspace.com/downloads/notification-mailgun/) extensions which were designed to support high volume emails in a single API call.

When using SMTP it's nearly impossible to send more than a dozen emails at once due to timeouts.

= Can I test my notifications before sending? =

Yes, just activate the debug log in the DEBUGGING section of the plugin settings. All notifications will be catched into log visible only to you.
